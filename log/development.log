Bãi biển Mỹ Khê : 1 trong 10 bãi biển quyến rũ nhất hành tinh, bãi biển đẳng cấp quốc tế, cực sạch.\n        3. Cầu khoá tình yêu : đường Trần Hưng Đạo\n        4. Đèo Hải Vân ( xa trung tâm ) : nhưng nên đi đông người.\n        5. Cầu sông Hàn : cầu xoay được.\n        6. Chùa Linh Ứng \n        7. Vòng quay mặt trời\n        8. Bán đảo Sơn Trà \n        9.

Thế nhưng cũng thật tiếc nếu bạn bỏ lỡ một số điểm thú vị sau khi ở Lăng Cô:\n        - Có thể đi chợ bằng xe ôm, hoặc thuê xe máy ở lễ tân các khu resort. Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-07 06:04:11.941915"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-07 06:04:11.941915"]]

        TRẢI NGHIỆM GÌ Ở ĐÀ NẴNG ? 
        Đà Nẵng rất ư đầu tư cho du lịch, mọi địa điểm hầu như luôn hướng tới khách du lịch.
        Bạn có thể ghé qua những địa điểm sau :
        1. Bà Nà Hills : Đây chắc là địa điểm đứng đầu rồi, vé 600K/người : mà thấy lúc nào cũng đông, mỗi ngày tầm 8,000 ~ 10,000 người lên đây, con số kinh khủng đúng không.
        Nhưng thực sự, ông chủ ở đây rất biết đầu tư cho du lịch.
        2. Bãi biển Mỹ Khê : 1 trong 10 bãi biển quyến rũ nhất hành tinh, bãi biển đẳng cấp quốc tế, cực sạch.
        3. Cầu khoá tình yêu : đường Trần Hưng Đạo
        4. Đèo Hải Vân ( xa trung tâm ) : nhưng nên đi đông người.
        5. Cầu sông Hàn : cầu xoay được.
        6. Chùa Linh Ứng 
        7. Vòng quay mặt trời
        8. Bán đảo Sơn Trà 
        9. Cầu Rồng ( phun nước và phun lửa vào mỗi 9h đêm thứ 7 và chủ nhật
        10. Cung thiếu nhi Đà Nẵng 
        11. Công viên Châu Á 
        13. Ngũ hành sơn ( cách trung tâm thành phố ĐN 7km) 
        14. Du thuyền dọc sông Hàn vào buổi đêm

        Đi biển thì tất nhiên tắm biển là số một rồi, nhất là với một bãi biển đẹp thuần khiết như ở Lăng Cô. Thế nhưng cũng thật tiếc nếu bạn bỏ lỡ một số điểm thú vị sau khi ở Lăng Cô:
        - Có thể đi chợ bằng xe ôm, hoặc thuê xe máy ở lễ tân các khu resort. Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.
        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.
        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.
        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.
        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài

Bà Nà Hills : Đây chắc là địa điểm đứng đầu rồi, vé 600K/người : mà thấy lúc nào cũng đông, mỗi ngày tầm 8,000 ~ 10,000 người lên đây, con số kinh khủng đúng không.\n        Nhưng thực sự, ông chủ ở đây rất biết đầu tư cho du lịch.\n        2. Bãi biển Mỹ Khê : 1 trong 10 bãi biển quyến rũ nhất hành tinh, bãi biển đẳng cấp quốc tế, cực sạch.\n        3. Cầu khoá tình yêu : đường Trần Hưng Đạo\n        4.

Thế nhưng cũng thật tiếc nếu bạn bỏ lỡ một số điểm thú vị sau khi ở Lăng Cô:\n        - Có thể đi chợ bằng xe ôm, hoặc thuê xe máy ở lễ tân các khu resort. Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-08 02:55:45.729486"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-08 02:55:45.729486"]]

Thế nhưng cũng thật tiếc nếu bạn bỏ lỡ một số điểm thú vị sau khi ở Lăng Cô:\n        - Có thể đi chợ bằng xe ôm, hoặc thuê xe máy ở lễ tân các khu resort. Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 02:54:54.478501"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 02:54:54.478501"]]

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:18:49.964949"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:18:49.964949"]]

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:21:42.654970"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:21:42.654970"]]

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:30:31.295622"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:30:31.295622"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã. Ảnh: Tuấn Đức\n        Những con phố mang tên “Hàng” giờ ra sao?\n        Khu phố cổ khá rộng, do vậy phải tận dụng hết thời gian mới khám phá trọn vẹn trong chuyến du lịch Hà Nội. Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội. Ảnh Ngọc Nguyễn\n        Nét cổ kính hoài niệm ở phố cổ Hà Nội\n        Đi qua phố cổ, du khách bắt gặp hình ảnh những ngôi nhà rêu phong theo thời gian, giờ đây vẫn hiên ngang trước bao đổi thay của không gian và thời gian. Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ.

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:47:54.184720"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:47:54.184720"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã. Ảnh: Tuấn Đức\n        Những con phố mang tên “Hàng” giờ ra sao?\n        Khu phố cổ khá rộng, do vậy phải tận dụng hết thời gian mới khám phá trọn vẹn trong chuyến du lịch Hà Nội. Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội. Ảnh Ngọc Nguyễn\n        Nét cổ kính hoài niệm ở phố cổ Hà Nội\n        Đi qua phố cổ, du khách bắt gặp hình ảnh những ngôi nhà rêu phong theo thời gian, giờ đây vẫn hiên ngang trước bao đổi thay của không gian và thời gian. Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ.

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:49:21.967947"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:49:21.967947"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã. Ảnh: Tuấn Đức\n        Những con phố mang tên “Hàng” giờ ra sao?\n        Khu phố cổ khá rộng, do vậy phải tận dụng hết thời gian mới khám phá trọn vẹn trong chuyến du lịch Hà Nội. Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội. Ảnh Ngọc Nguyễn\n        Nét cổ kính hoài niệm ở phố cổ Hà Nội\n        Đi qua phố cổ, du khách bắt gặp hình ảnh những ngôi nhà rêu phong theo thời gian, giờ đây vẫn hiên ngang trước bao đổi thay của không gian và thời gian. Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ. Một chút lặng lẽ, một chút thanh tao đã thôi thúc bao lữ khách dừng chân lưu luyến mỗi độ về với Thủ đô yêu thương."], ["address_id", 1], ["user_id", 6], ["views_number", 100], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:49:22.006442"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:49:22.006442"]]

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:28.318973"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:28.318973"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã. Ảnh: Tuấn Đức\n        Những con phố mang tên “Hàng” giờ ra sao?\n        Khu phố cổ khá rộng, do vậy phải tận dụng hết thời gian mới khám phá trọn vẹn trong chuyến du lịch Hà Nội. Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội. Ảnh Ngọc Nguyễn\n        Nét cổ kính hoài niệm ở phố cổ Hà Nội\n        Đi qua phố cổ, du khách bắt gặp hình ảnh những ngôi nhà rêu phong theo thời gian, giờ đây vẫn hiên ngang trước bao đổi thay của không gian và thời gian. Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ.

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:41.725661"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:41.725661"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã.

Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội.

Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ. Một chút lặng lẽ, một chút thanh tao đã thôi thúc bao lữ khách dừng chân lưu luyến mỗi độ về với Thủ đô yêu thương."], ["address_id", 1], ["user_id", 6], ["views_number", 100], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:41.753722"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 03:58:41.753722"]]

Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 04:00:38.831171"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 04:00:38.831171"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã.

Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội.

Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ. Một chút lặng lẽ, một chút thanh tao đã thôi thúc bao lữ khách dừng chân lưu luyến mỗi độ về với Thủ đô yêu thương."], ["address_id", 1], ["user_id", 6], ["views_number", 100], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 04:00:38.871424"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 04:00:38.871424"]]

Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh.

Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-09 04:09:56.622796"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-09 04:09:56.622796"]]

Được xem là cái nôi lưu giữ những gì cổ kính, hoài niệm một thời vẫn còn vẹn nguyên những nét trầm mặc theo dòng xoáy thời gian và chính điều này đã trở thành lý do thôi thúc nhiều lữ khách đến thăm nơi đây một lần trong đời.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội tọa lạc ở phía Tây Bắc quận Hoàn Kiếm, sở hữu vị trí trung tâm, đắc địa của Thủ đô. Nhắc tới phố cổ Hà Nội, không ai không biết tới địa danh 36 phố phường. Mỗi con phố lưu giữ những nét đặc trưng của đất kinh kỳ, những ký ức về lịch sử, con người và đất nước. Trải qua bao thăng trầm, những con phố ấy vẫn còn tồn tại vẹn nguyên đến tận bây giờ. \n        Từ xa xưa, phố cổ là tên gọi của một khu đô thị, được hình thành từ đời Lý – Trần, nằm ở phía Đông Hoàng thành Thăng Long ra đến sát sông Hồng. Trước đây, các làng nghề bao quanh Thăng Long, tập trung buôn bán, mỗi con phố là một làng nghề khác nhau mang dấu ấn riêng biệt của cư dân thành thị và cùng trao đổi lẫn nhau trong cuộc sống đời thường. Chính vì vậy, ngày nay chúng ta thấy những con đường trong khu phố cổ đều có từ “Hàng” đặt ở đầu. Đến đây, bạn đã lý giải được thắc mắc tại sao phố cổ Hà Nội lại có 36 phố phường mang tên “Hàng” rồi nhỉ?\n        Một góc phố Hàng Mã. Ảnh: Tuấn Đức\n        Những con phố mang tên “Hàng” giờ ra sao?\n        Khu phố cổ khá rộng, do vậy phải tận dụng hết thời gian mới khám phá trọn vẹn trong chuyến du lịch Hà Nội. Đi qua con phố Hàng Mã, bạn sẽ thấy những cửa hàng chuyên bán các mặt hàng thờ cúng, vàng mã, hay Hàng Thiếc bày bán những đồ gia dụng được làm từ vật liệu thiếc. \n        Trước đây, hầu như tất cả những con phố đều chuyên bán một loại mặt hàng mang thương hiệu riêng nhưng hiện tại cũng có một số tuyến phố xuất hiện những mặt hàng mới không theo nguyên tắc xưa. Minh chứng như tuyến phố Hàng Quạt, nếu như trước đây buôn bán quạt và đàn, nay được kinh doanh thêm mặt hàng như tranh thêu, câu đối… \n        Khu phố cổ Hà Nội. Ảnh Ngọc Nguyễn\n        Nét cổ kính hoài niệm ở phố cổ Hà Nội\n        Đi qua phố cổ, du khách bắt gặp hình ảnh những ngôi nhà rêu phong theo thời gian, giờ đây vẫn hiên ngang trước bao đổi thay của không gian và thời gian. Những ngôi nhà được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, với những lối đi nhỏ bên trong căn nhà và gạch xây dựng đã trở nên cũ kỹ là khung cảnh quen thuộc chẳng lẫn vào đâu giữa lòng Thủ đô. \n        Đến thăm nơi đây, du khách không nên bỏ qua những ngôi đền, chùa cổ kính như đền Mã Mây, đền Bà Chúa, chùa Cầu Đông, chùa Kim Cổ… Lữ khách còn có cơ hội tham quan cửa ô Quan Chưởng – dấu mốc của một thời kỳ vàng son của Thủ đô ngàn năm văn hiến. \n        Nét cổ kính của Ô Quan Chưởng - Ảnh Linh Nguyễn\n        Nếu hỏi có hình ảnh nào gắn liền với phố cổ để người ta cảm nhận rõ rệt nhất một Hà Nội đơn sơ, bình dị và đẹp đẽ thì chỉ đơn giản là gánh hàng rong, xe tào phớ với tiếng leng keng khắp các nẻo phố hay vị thơm ngon của tô bún thang hoặc bát phở bốc khói nghi ngút vào mỗi sáng sớm cũng làm say đắm bao con tim du khách để phải dừng chân lại ngắm nhìn và thưởng thức.\n        Phố cổ Hà Nội không chỉ lưu giữ mà thực ra cũng chính là linh hồn của Thủ đô. Đối lập với vẻ hào nhoáng xa hoa, rực rỡ cùng những công trình kiến trúc hiện đại là phố cổ giản dị và bình yên đến lạ.
