Bà Nà Hills : Đây chắc là địa điểm đứng đầu rồi, vé 600K/người : mà thấy lúc nào cũng đông, mỗi ngày tầm 8,000 ~ 10,000 người lên đây, con số kinh khủng đúng không.\n        Nhưng thực sự, ông chủ ở đây rất biết đầu tư cho du lịch.\n        2. Bãi biển Mỹ Khê : 1 trong 10 bãi biển quyến rũ nhất hành tinh, bãi biển đẳng cấp quốc tế, cực sạch.\n        3. Cầu khoá tình yêu : đường Trần Hưng Đạo\n        4. Đèo Hải Vân ( xa trung tâm ) : nhưng nên đi đông người.\n        5. Cầu sông Hàn : cầu xoay được.\n        6. Chùa Linh Ứng \n        7. Vòng quay mặt trời\n        8. Bán đảo Sơn Trà \n        9.

Thế nhưng cũng thật tiếc nếu bạn bỏ lỡ một số điểm thú vị sau khi ở Lăng Cô:\n        - Có thể đi chợ bằng xe ôm, hoặc thuê xe máy ở lễ tân các khu resort. Ở đó có thể mua tông Lào, quần áo, thắt lưng đánh từ Lào về, khá rẻ. Sau đó bạn nên dạo xe máy trên cung đường du lịch ven đầm Lập An, một bên đầm một bên núi sẽ rất thi vị và có những kỷ niệm không bao giờ quên. Tha hồ chụp ảnh và ngắm cảnh. Đầm này đáy toàn là vỏ trai ốc, không có bùn, nên lội ra rất xa cũng chỉ đến bắp chân thôi, nước trong vắt.\n        - Bãi biển Chân Mây: bãi Chân Mây bằng phẳng kéo dài hình vòng cung, cát trắng và sóng hiền hòa, cách quốc lộ 1A chỉ gần 3km. Bãi tắm ở đây rất đẹp tuy nhiên nếu tắm ở đây bạn phải lưu ý sẽ không có người cứu hộ túc trực, không có hệ thống cảnh báo nguy hiểm.\n        - Đèo Hải Vân: Bắt đầu từ Hải Vân Quan, địa phận của tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế trên đèo Hải Vân, kéo dài đến vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã chỉ vỏn vẹn chưa đầy 60km nhưng bảo đảm bạn sẽ ngất ngây với những gì trước mắt. Đổ đèo Hải Vân, bạn có thể quan sát vịnh Lăng Cô, đường dẫn vào hầm Hải Vân từ trên cao.\n        Chạy hết đèo, bạn sẽ đến ngã ba để ra quốc lộ 1A, tuy nhiên, bạn không nên chạy đường này mà hãy rẽ trái vào đường Nguyễn Văn để có thể ngắm toàn cảnh đầm Lập An vô cùng đẹp và thơ mộng. Trên đường có nhiều quán hải sản được dựng ngay trên đầm, bạn có thể nghỉ chân vừa thưởng thức hải sản, vừa ngắm cảnh rất tuyệt vời.\n        - Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã: Cách Lăng Cô khoảng 30 km về phía Tây, Bạch Mã nổi tiếng có khí hậu mát mẻ. Nhiệt độ chưa bao giờ dưới 4 độ C và cao hơn 26 độ C. Tại đây, bạn có thể dạo bộ thưởng thức không khí của núi rừng bạch mã, thăm quan cụm thác Ngũ Hổ, thác Đỗ Quyền, chinh phục đỉnh Bạch Mã, tham quan Vọng Hải Đài \n        (từ đây chiêm ngưỡng toàn cảnh vịnh Chân Mây và đầm Cầu Hai)."], ["address_id", 31], ["user_id", 2], ["views_number", 60], ["created_at", "2018-10-07 06:04:11.941915"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-07 06:04:11.941915"]]
